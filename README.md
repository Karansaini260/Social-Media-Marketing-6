In this project, learners use Stable Diffusion to create images from text descriptions. They assemble the Stable Diffusion pipeline using several pre-trained neural networks, and learn how to fine-tune the networks to include new image information. With the goal of generating meme-worthy images, learners also create and deploy a Streamlit app.
